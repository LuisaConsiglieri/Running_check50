# Running_check50
Creating a check and running it. 

(1) Create a git repo. Your new repo should live at https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.

(2) Create the .cs50.yaml file. All indentation is done by 2 spaces, as per YAML syntax.

(3) Simply execute: check50 <owner>/<repo>/master/example --local
Where you substitute <owner> for your own username,
<repo> for the repo you’ve just created = Running_check50,
master = main.

(4) That’s it! You know have a repo that check50 can use to check whether a python file called hello.py
prints Hello, world! and exits with a 0 as exit code.
